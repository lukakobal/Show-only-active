# React 51 – Derived Data & Filtering 🧠⚛️

This app demonstrates a **core React concept**:  
**derived data instead of extra state**.

## Key concepts
- `useState` triggers re-render
- component function runs again on every render
- filtered data is calculated directly in render
- no `useEffect` needed

## Why this matters
This pattern is used **everywhere** in real React projects and interviews.

✅ Clean  
✅ Predictable  
✅ Easy to reason about
